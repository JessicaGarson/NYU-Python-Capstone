# Deadlines 

## November 15th 
Idea emailed to me (this can be a list or a idea that isn't quite flushed out) we'll be talking more about what makes a good project in the first class but having some idea of what you will be working on will make the first class run a bit smoother. 

## November 29th
Project proposal due. This is a fully flushed out idea with a plan of action. 

## December 13th 
A prototype. You should have something that somewhat works but may be unfinished by this point. 

## December 20th 
In class demos. This should be a finished product.
