# Today We're Going to Make Some Internet Happen

## Intro Activity GitHub Pages
Follow the tutorial for the GitHub Pages found in the repo. We will all leave today with some fun things to show.

## Deploying of the Slides
I use [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to make our slides for every class and post them to my personal site. This is hosted with my personal domain.

## The Landscape of Deployment
We'll talk a bit about the landscape of deployment in 2017. A very good talk on this subject is by Andrew Baker from pycon called [5 ways to deploy your app in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGphzPLemZE).

## Exposing your Local Environment
We'll do a fun activity with ngrok and creating a site off our local dev environment. We'll discuss the pros and cons of this approach.

## AWS
AWS is a popular option. Here are some links to get you started. The two most common ways to do this are with S3 and Elastic Beanstalk. There is a serverless option called AWS Lambda.

We'll discuss the pros and cons of this approach.

## Python Anywhere
Really great for beginners.
- [Flask](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/)
- [Django](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/FollowingTheDjangoTutorial)

## Digital Ocean
Droplets are another low cost option for hosting.
- [Flask](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04)
- [Django](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-django-one-click-install-image-for-ubuntu-16-04)

## Heroku
For today's class we'll be focusing on Heroku pretty heavily. We'll be doing a few live deploys of Heroku.

We'll be doing the [heroku tutorial live](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up) and deploying our class site using [this method](https://coderwall.com/p/pstm1w/deploying-a-flask-app-at-heroku).

## Breaking Up Into Pairs
We'll be breaking up into teams and deploying a project from last semester.  

## Other Options for Deployment
Some other options include configuring your own VM with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
and thinking inside the box using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
