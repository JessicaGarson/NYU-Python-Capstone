# GitHub
Let's make a very basic site with github pages

# Step 1
Crete a repo named `yourusername.github.io` so for example mine would be JessicaGarson.github.io

# Step 2
Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io
```
# Step 3
Let's create a hello world website

# Step 4
Let's add some simple content

```bash
cd username.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
```

# Step 6
Let's commit our content

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "adding hello world"
git push
```

# Step 7
Got to yourusername.github.io in your browser and see what appeared!

# Step 8
Go into go GitHub and into the settings tab and play around the themes for pages.

# Bonus Step
Let's add some more additional content to the site.
