### Dean Capstone Idea
I would like to make an app that collects and visualizes cycling/cyclist data (traffic, accidents, stats, etc.), that can be sorted through and customized as a dashboard.
One idea Ive had is to include a feature so a user can enter a starting and ending location, and get some statistics about relevant bike route(s).

#### Some thoughts on this project:
The goal will be to share valuable information about cycling, not clone Google Maps. 
In searching for valuable information, it may be useful to source information from other data sources (other cities, info about cost of cycling, cost of medical care for accidents, cost of road work, health benefits of cycling, pollution impact of cars vs. cycling).
