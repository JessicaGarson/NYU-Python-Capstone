### Dean Capstone Idea
I would like to make an app that collects and visualizes cycling/cyclist data (traffic, accidents, stats, etc.), that can be sorted through and customized as a dashboard.
One idea I've had is to include a feature so a user can enter a starting and ending location, and get some statistics about relevant bike route(s).
