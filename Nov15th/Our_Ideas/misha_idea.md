I want to build on portfolio optimizationproject that I did during last class. I plan to use Yahoo API to get data, maybe I will find some other good sources for interactive data. The basic idea it to have a tool to run portfolio optimization, and couple of graphs. 

The scaling would be to have some additional functionalities and possible small deshboard. Maybe some regression analysis and basic models. 

The very last step would be to put it on the website, but that is if I have time. I would ruther do cleaning the data and back end stuff than trying to figure out website.
