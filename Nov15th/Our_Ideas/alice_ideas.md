# Alice's Capstone Ideas

## 1: Brunch Finder!!

This would basically be something you input certain search functions in, then use some sort of API (Yelp? FourSquare?) and gives you back like a top three results that meet your criteria

It sounds very similar to what's around, but sometimes you want very boozy brunch and sometimes you need it to be good for groups or have reservations available at 12:30. 


## 2: Solo travel searches?

Fun heat map of solo travel searches or solo travel destinations to make it very easy for solo travelers to find resources and friends. Could be specific to female solo travel or not...again maybe use existing travel APIs 

## 3: Warbdrobe + weather guide

Wardobe suggestions based on weather and your style. Use Pinterest API?
