# Project

My capstone project is to automate as much of my weekly reporting I do for work as possible. The plan is very preliminary. I expect to find a lot of blockers I need to work around given how both the JIRA and Confluence APIs work, and potentially with how Plotly works. This may end up looking very different than how it's sketched out now, but the main goal is to get to a place where weekly reporting is something that can be generated by anyone, instead of just by me.

# Architecture, contextual information, & assumptions
* Page will be created manually and will still have to be run
* "Running" will just involve selecting start and end dates in a picker
* Date picker should only be available when editing the page, otherwise just display at bottom of page somewhere
* We're probably moving off of Kace next year, not really worth automating any of that until it's been redone in JIRA
* Project updates can't be done automatically yet, but worth visualizing the architecture now so that people can start putting habits in place that will allow it
* Start and end dates will be the actual first and last day of the reporting time frame (the end date will not be the day after)

## Sections of reporting
* Bill's ticket info
* My ticket info
* Ticket info graphs
* Service Desk SLAs
* INS & FS SLAs
* Service Desk work breakdown
* Systems work breakdown
* New accounts & terminations
* Key ratios
* Interrupt scheduling
* Prod updates
* Project updates

## Additional features that need to be built
* Posting graphs to page automatically
* Filtering page based on date statically
* Posting data to page automatically
* Redesigning page to allow the above to happen - will happen naturally as project develops

# Ignoring for Capstone due to context
* Bill's ticket info
* Service Desk SLAs
* Service Desk work breakdown
* Project updates
