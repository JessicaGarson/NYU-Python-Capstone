## My idea

Using python + regex, a sentiment analysis, perhaps tracking certain keywords across different medias. 

Examples of search APIs:

- Twitter: [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference]
- NYT: [http://developer.nytimes.com/]

*Ideally, I'd like to turn this into a tool where a user could imput and compare terms.*

# Potential pitfalls: 

- I'm going to have to find enough sources to make it a worthwhile tool. 
- It might be good to store the searches somewhere.
- The visualisation part might be time-consumming but necessary to make the tool look good.
